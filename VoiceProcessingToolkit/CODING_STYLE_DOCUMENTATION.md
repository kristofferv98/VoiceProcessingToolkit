## Coding Style Documentation

This document outlines the coding practices and principles followed when writing Python programs or scripts within this codebase.

### Code Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs.
- **Line Length**: Keep lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- **Imports**: Group imports into three blocks: standard library, third-party libraries, and local modules.
- **Whitespace**: Use whitespace to improve readability, following PEP 8 guidelines.

### Naming Conventions

- **Modules**: Use short, lowercase names. If necessary, use underscores to improve readability.
- **Classes**: Use the CapWords convention.
- **Functions and Variables**: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores.
- **Constants**: Use all uppercase with words separated by underscores.

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Follow PEP 257 for docstring conventions. Use triple double quotes and include a summary line, a blank line, and any further elaboration if necessary.
- **Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly and only when they add value to the understanding of the code.

### Best Practices

- **Code Simplicity**: Write simple and straightforward code. Avoid complex and clever code that is hard to read and maintain.
- **Code Readability**: Code should be easily readable by others. Use descriptive variable and function names.
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for error handling rather than return codes.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new code and run them regularly.
- **Version Control**: Make small, incremental changes and commit often with descriptive messages.

### Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication by abstracting repeated code into functions or classes.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Do not add functionality until it is necessary.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Keep code simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow the SOLID principles for object-oriented design.

### Code Reviews

- **Peer Review**: All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Feedback should be constructive and focus on improving code quality and maintainability.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **Automated Testing**: Use continuous integration tools to run tests automatically on every push.
- **Automated Deployment**: Use continuous deployment tools to automate the deployment process.

By adhering to these guidelines, we maintain a high standard of code quality and consistency throughout the project.
